#Hi there
##Publishing [0:16:11 - 0:18:50]
Instead of writing DITA content and then publishing the whole dita map to an output format (deliverable), the DITA content is stored in a CCMS on a (web)server and output is generated on the fly when the user requests to see a page in his web browser.
##In-browser DITA editing [0:23:23 - 0:32:09]
People with different roles can edit different pieces of content, depending their roles.
##Review [0:38:25 - 0:40:27]
In-browser review: write content in DITA and save DITA source files on a webserver. Reviewers can review and edit the content directly in the browser.
